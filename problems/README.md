# Problems Journal (Learning Log)

Each LeetCode problem lives in its own folder under `problems/`.

For learning purposes, each problem should also have a **`notes.md`** file that records:

- what you tried
- what went wrong / bugs
- the key idea / pattern
- complexity analysis
- edge cases you missed
- what you would do differently next time

Use `problems/template/notes.md` as the starting point.
